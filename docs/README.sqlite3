This is a kornshell93 function library to interface with sqlite3
databases. It is developed and tested with ksh 93u+.

This is a place holder to remind me to write a short guide on
how to use these functions.

need to mention:
- using FPATH
- setting up compound variables to store connection context
- how to retrieve replies
- how to handle errors
